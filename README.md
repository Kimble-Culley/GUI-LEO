# GUI-LEO

This repository is a companion to the LEO project.
It is purely a GUI for integration. 
I am keeping its development separate so it can be used as a template for other projects.
Raylib is used to create the graphical interfaces.

# TODO
```
- [] Create a file management system.
- [] Make system calls dynamic.
```
